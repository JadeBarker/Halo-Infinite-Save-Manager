# Halo Infinite Save Manager

This tool requires Python to function. You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Locate your main Steam directory, this will typically be located in `Program Files (x86)`.

Navigate to this folder within the directory: `Steam/userdata/<UserID>/1240440/remote/<ID>/Save`. This is where you will find the `progress2.cb2` file. It is your save file, and what we will be copying, and overwriting with this tool.

I do not provide any saves with this tool, as savegames cannot be shared between two people. So you will have to create your own practice saves throughout the game. To do this, just navigate your way through Halo Infinite, until you get to a point in which you would like to be able to go back to, such as Warship Gbraakson, or Foundation. Then once you have verified that your game has saved at the beginning of that level, copy the `progress2.cb2` file into it's respective folder included in the file directory of the Halo Infinite Save Manager. For example, if you created a save for Warship Gbraakson, you would copy your `progress2.cb2` file into the Warship Gbraakson folder.

Once you have created your saves, you will now be able to use the Halo Infinite Save Manager to switch between your savegames as you wish. Take in mind that any saves that have not been backed up will be overwritten by the tool, and lost forever.

Halo Infinite must be restarted each time you switch between your save files.
